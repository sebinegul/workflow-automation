# Workflow Automation Builder

This is a React-based workflow automation builder that allows users to create, visualize, and manage workflows. The application features an interactive canvas for dragging and dropping nodes, configuring node properties, and visualizing workflows in real-time. It also includes advanced features like undo/redo functionality, workflow export/import, and a responsive design.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
Install Dependencies
bashCopy
cd <project-directory>
npm install
Run the Application
bashCopy
npm run start
This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.
Features
Core Features
Workflow Canvas
Interactive canvas using React Flow.
Drag-and-drop nodes and connect them with edges.
Supports three types of nodes: "Task", "Condition", and "Notification".
Nodes and edges can be deleted.
Node Configuration
Side panel with a form to configure node properties.
Forms built using React Hook Form.
Unique forms for each node type with relevant fields.
Workflow Data Table
Table summarizing all nodes in the workflow.
Columns include "Node Type", "Node Name", "Status", and "Actions".
Inline editing of node properties directly from the table.
Advanced Features
Validation
Form validation for required fields and date validation.
Undo/Redo
Undo and redo functionality for node and edge actions.
Export/Import
Export workflow as a JSON file.
Import workflow from a JSON file.
Abstraction and Reusability
Reusable Components
Workflow canvas, node configuration forms, and data table are reusable.
Custom hooks for form handling, workflow state management, and undo/redo functionality.
Design and User Experience
Styling
Styled using Tailwind CSS for a clean and intuitive UI.
Responsive design for different screen sizes.
Animations
Smooth drag-and-drop and form transitions.
Performance Optimization
Efficient Handling
Optimized for performance with memoization and virtualized rendering.
Efficient handling of large workflows.
Bonus Features
Real-Time Collaboration
Optional feature to allow multiple users to edit the same workflow simultaneously using WebSockets.
Conditional Logic for Edges
Optional feature to implement conditional logic for edges.
Unit Tests
Optional feature to write unit tests for critical components using Jest and React Testing Library.
Usage
Workflow Canvas
Adding Nodes
Click on the "Add Task", "Add Condition", or "Add Notification" buttons to add nodes to the canvas.
Nodes are randomly positioned on the canvas.
Connecting Nodes
Click and drag from the source node to the target node to create an edge.
Deleting Nodes and Edges
Click on a node or edge and use the delete button in the toolbar to remove it.
Node Configuration
Editing Nodes
Click on a node to open the configuration panel on the right side.
Fill in the form fields to update the node properties.
Click "Save" to apply changes or "Cancel" to discard them.
Workflow Data Table
Viewing and Editing Nodes
Click the "View Table" button in the toolbar to open the workflow data table.
Edit node properties directly from the table.
Click "Save" to apply changes or "Delete" to remove a node.
Undo/Redo
Undo and Redo Actions
Use the "Undo" and "Redo" buttons in the toolbar to revert or reapply actions.
Export/Import
Export Workflow
Click the "Export" button in the toolbar to download the workflow as a JSON file.
Import Workflow
Click the "Import" button in the toolbar and select a JSON file to import a workflow.
Design Decisions and Trade-offs
React Flow
Chosen for its robustness and ease of use for creating interactive graphs.
Trade-off: It may not be as lightweight as some other libraries.
React Hook Form
Used for efficient form handling and validation.
Trade-off: Adds an additional dependency.
React Table
Used for displaying and editing workflow data.
Trade-off: Requires careful handling of state updates to maintain performance.
Tailwind CSS
Chosen for its utility-first approach to styling.
Trade-off: May result in larger CSS files compared to other styling solutions.
Assumptions
Node Types
Only three types of nodes ("Task", "Condition", "Notification") are supported.
Additional node types can be added by extending the nodeTypes array and creating corresponding components.
Form Validation
Basic validation rules are implemented. More complex validation can be added as needed.
Performance
The application is optimized for handling large workflows, but performance may degrade with extremely large datasets.
Conclusion
This application provides a comprehensive solution for workflow automation, combining powerful libraries and best practices in React development. It offers a user-friendly interface, robust functionality, and opportunities for further enhancement.
